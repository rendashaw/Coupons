### Known Bugs / Quirks
- must 'visualize' a drop table before it can be rolled
- roll section is hard-coded and not linked to execute API currently
- poop and sword animations are hard-coded tied to the junk item and sword item
- not responsive webapp
- the roll chest table is linked to a library for exporting 3d models so I am unsure if this will work as dormant forever
- first time really using react, something like redux would have probably helped (from my brief research)
- no error messages on front end
- dont think editing certain parts of a pool is fully functional / responsive on front 

### Usage Notes
- In `src/controllers/Controller.ts`, fill in the credentials at the top (note: only certain titles have access to drop tables currently)

### Current State
#### Completed
- Catalog CRUD APIs for Drop Tables
- MongoDB Database Containers for Draft / Published Drop Table Details
- Catalog Evaluate Drop Table API

#### In Progress
- Main Server Error Message Builders for Drop Table APIs [PR](https://github.com/PlayFab/pf-main/pull/18898)

#### Issues
- GetEntityItems API to work for Drop Tables (Drop Table items not returning DropTableDetails in response)
- Search API to work for Drop Tables (Drop Table items not returning DropTableDetails in response)
- APIs to have end-to-end tests

#### Notes
- Maybe adding ExpandDropTableDetails (similar to ExpandItemReferences) functionality?

### Next Steps
- Add Drop Table Execution API to Inventory
- Create Game Manager / Future UX
